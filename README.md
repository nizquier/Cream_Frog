This project employs Plotly, a graphing library for Python, to display an interactive bar chart of employment rates in the US since 1940. We designed a product called *Job Finder* to allow job seekers to search and apply for jobs, as well as network with fellow colleagues and potential employers. 

Through the use of our data visualizations and the product we designed, new college graduates and seasoned professionals alike, will be able to secure employment and/or further their professional careers more efficiently.
